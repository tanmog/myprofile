  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>Born to a family of bankers, I naturally inherited the passion for finance. I would listen to my father in awe while he explained the importance of money management through investment across diversified channels. He would often playfully handover some numbers of risk and return of the market and assets, and would ask me to calculate the various ratios like Beta of an asset, Sharpe ratio and demonstrate its use in portfolio diversification through the use of computational tools like MS Excel. I found these discussions extremely intriguing and developed a deep interest in the workings of the investment market. I had my baptism by fire in 2010, starting my investment journey with my savings of 100 dollars. Over the next few years, I grew my portfolio, diversifying into many sectors. However, the accuracy and the swiftness of trading software in matching orders veritably caught my attention. I was spellbound by the capability of computers and the engineering involved that can be harnessed in the field of finance. </p>
  <br>
  <p>Inspired by the power of computation in reducing human intervention and efforts, I was motivated to pursue a technical career in computer science. It was a dream come true when I secured a rank in the top 2 percentile out of 150,000 participants in VIT examinations, one of the premier institutes of the country. During my undergraduate study, I enrolled for courses like Programming in C, C++, Data structures, Calculus, Linear algebra, Probability & statistics, and consistently scored in the top 5 percentile in these topics. These courses helped me gain a strong fundamental in mathematics and computer science and apply these concepts in the practical sessions of laboratory work. However, it was during my probability class when all the calculations and probabilistic methods employed by my father in risk management and the role probability plays in developing pricing models for equities, bonds, and other derivative securities started making more sense.</p>
  <br>
  <p>During this period, an unfortunate event happened. My cousin, a practiced businessman went bankrupt, and his textile business had to be shut down within a few months. I was shocked to learn how biases can affect people with such immense financial and business acumen. This episode intrigued me, and I wanted to explore the translation of theoretical financial concepts into the real world. A bit of research landed me in risk management, and I finally did my undergrad thesis on a related topic. My project was “Hybrid deep learning Model for Bankruptcy prediction.”. I used the feature selection algorithm ‘Relief’ and CNN to identify companies likely to file for bankruptcy and compared the results with other models that had used logistic regression and random forest. Though a novice attempt to such a high impact topic, it introduced me to the world of computational finance. The potential of ML and Data Mining in managing the risks in finance excited me. </p>
  <br>
  <p>After graduation, I maneuvered my entire focus in enhancing my programming skills and gaining practical exposure which channeled the way for me to start my career as an Engineer in Mahindra Comviva, a leading telecommunications company and a Market leader in Mobile Financial solutions. Working in the roadmap team, I was involved in the development of new features for Multi-Channel Campaign Management suite, which equips operators with tools to develop strategies to maximize customer lifetime value. Based on consumer usage behavior, we send personalized offers to the customer in real time, which enhances subscriber experiences. My innovation of including the technological impact on offer price in the feature set of campaign management helped the client in micro-segmenting their customer base effectively which led to an increase in revenue by over 15%. At Comviva, I was also a part of Digital Payments team where I was responsible for designing the technical architecture of the mobile and web application for the product. My role was multifaceted as I had to collaborate with the business and the implementation teams which helped me improve my creative thinking and interpersonal skills. Now, after having a decent insight into the backend of mobile finance, I got an opportunity to work as a Product pricing consultant in a Real estate Start-up. In my short stint, I worked closely with them in the areas of cash flow mechanism, target clientele identification and operating costs and also provided my inputs on how technology could be used to fast-track this process. However, my limited financial knowledge became a challenge in comprehensively understanding the various concepts. To address this lacuna, I enrolled for several courses like “Portfolio and Risk Management,” “Investment Fundamentals and Data Analytics” and capstone course “Machine learning and Reinforcement learning in Finance” offered by institutions like Indian School of Business and NYU. This further fostered the bug in me to know more about finance, and I enrolled for the Chartered Financial Analyst(CFA) certification program. I have cleared Level 1 of the course (Jun 2018) and intend to complete the entire CFA certification by June 2020. This course will enable me to seamlessly operate at the intersection of computer science, math, and finance.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Not restricted to academics, I've been actively involved in co-curricular activities throughout my undergrad tenure. Raised in a family where social activities were always given high priority, I have had a natural affinity for social service. These indulgements have been a prominent driving force for me to volunteer for National Service Scheme (NSS) during my under-graduation, where I, in a team of 8 members, had to arrange 15 blood donation and health awareness camps for the underprivileged rural people. Besides this, I have hosted several technological competitions for Inter-Collegiate Science Events. Pursuing my passion for teaching, I've mentored remedial classes in mathematics for my peers during undergrad and have even taught students online for over 500hours. Even today, I continue to take part in Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiative by my employer, organizing several intense educational and social boot-camps for the underprivileged in Bangalore. I believe all this all-rounded experience have developed me as a proactive leader, the learning of which I can take forward and contribute in my classes at your esteemed university.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Four years of academic and 2+ years of professional experience in computer science have equipped me with a multitude of problem-solving skill sets. My strong Math base in topics such as Probability, Statistics, and Multivariable Calculus will help me navigate the quant-heavy coursework of the MFE program. My experience of teaching mathematics online has made me empathetic to the perspective of other people; this would help in collaborating with the diverse body of experiences of my classmates and faculty members. Passionate about pursuing a career in risk management, the prospect of getting a chance to work under the guidance of Prof. Agostino Capponi certainly excites me. I want to leverage his expertise in the field of "systemic risk" and learn its consequences in destabilizing a firm or industry. Getting the chance to work with him, I'd like to explore the possibilities of incorporating the principles of systemic risk to predict the bankruptcy of any firm/industry. </p>
  <br>
  <p>A degree in a multidisciplinary course of finance would prepare me for a successful career as a quantitative risk analyst. The intellectually stimulating environment at Columbia provides many opportunities for growth personally and professionally. Exposure to the financial services industry would provide me with opportunities to apply my coding expertise with theoretical knowledge in finance. In 3-5 years I intend to pivot from a “decision-enabling” to a “decision-making” role regarding investments in a large organization. In the long term, I envision myself moving to an advisory role in emerging markets. By leveraging AI and ML, I intend to create a platform where I can democratize investment advice and make it accessible to people around the world. I believe this would help create long-term wealth for the masses in developing economies.
